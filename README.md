# scraper-0.2
An updated version of the scraper malware, and yes it actually runs now, so no need to fix that. 
let me know what you think of it. mostly made in python and vbscript, 
took about an hour to complete the project, i will be updating this every weekend. this will only run in windows 10 
(windows 7 maybe as well) you will also need python 3.9 or you can just run the executable in /build/scraper/

# WARNING
This is REAL malware and will damage your system, you should only run this in a VM (virtual machine) 
unless you just want to demolish your system for some reason, the best virtualization software right now 
is Virtualbox, you can download Virtualbox at https://www.virtualbox.com/wiki/downloads microsoft has a 
free iso file of windows 10 you can run in virtualbox.

# Release notes

1. Added sleep timer

2. Added .exe file in /build/scraper/

3. Fixed immideate restart
